<p style="text-align: justify;">
  World Class University has a sky-high building for student residence.

  WS building had a World Class Elevator. 
  Because of the extraordinary quality, WS only needs one elevator to accommodate all of the collegers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  There are $$$N$$$ passenger in first floor inside the elevator right now.
  The $$$i$$$-th passenger of the the elevator wants to get to $$$X_{i}$$$-th floor and has an elevator tolerance value of $$$Y_{i}$$$. 
  The elevator tolerance value concludes the range of floors so that 
  the $$$i$$$-th passenger won't get annoyed if the $$$i$$$-th passenger got dropped 
  between floor $$$X_{i} - Y_{i}$$$ and $$$X_{i} + Y_{i}$$$ (inclusive). 
  After the ride passenger can go to the desired floor using the stairs. 
  Mind that every passenger could have a different value of elevator tolerance. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You need to find the least number of discharge required for World Class Elevator 
  to deliver all of the passengers from the first floor without annoying anyone. 
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with a single integer $$$T (1 \leq T \leq 10)$$$ the number of test cases. 
  The next lines contain the description of each test case as explained below. <br>
  The first line of each case contains a positive integer $$$N (1 \leq N \leq 10^5) - $$$ the number of passenger. <br>
  The next $$$N$$$ lines contains 2 integers $$$X_{i} (2 \leq X_{i} \leq 10^5)$$$ and $$$Y_{i} (0 \leq Y_{i} \leq 10^5) - $$$ 
  the destination and the elevator tolerance value of the $$$i$$$-th passenger. 
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output Kasus #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$" (without quotation marks), where $$$X$$$ is the case number starting from 1, 
  and $$$Y$$$ is the least number of discharge required for World Class Elevator to deliver all of the passengers.

Kasus #1: 1
Kasus #2: 2  
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For the first case, World-Class Elevator would only stop once on the fourth floor. <br>
  In the second case, World Class Elevator will stop twice, one of the combinations of optimal stoppage is by stopping in the fourth and twelfth floor.
