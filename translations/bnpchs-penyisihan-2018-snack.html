<!--snacks-->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A member of the Bollyjee club, Jelix, likes to share foods. One of Jelix's favourite food is Snacks. One day when he was training in a training room, he brought snacks for him to share. Initially, there are $$$N$$$ that are brought to the training room. Then, Jelix and $$$K$$$ of his friends will receive snacks.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  Jelix is a kind person. So, he doesn't want to play favour (for example one must not receive snacks more than others) so everybody will get the same amount of snacks. However, he does not like bringing home extra snacks (formally, the snacks must be divided out and there must not be any remainder). Your job is to help Jellix decide whether or not the snacks that he brought can be divided according to those two rules. Output "ya" without quotation marks if possible or "no" without quotation marks if it is not possible.
