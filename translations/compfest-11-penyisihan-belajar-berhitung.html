<!-- Title : Learning to Count -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Chanek is a math teacher. Today, he is teaching $N$ students to count. Pak Chanek will give his $i$-th student 
  an interval of numbers $[L_i, R_i]$. Then, the student will take turns (from student $1$ to student $N$) counting 
  all numbers on the interval $[L_i, R_i]$ that has not been counted by a previous student. For example, say student 
  $1$ gets interval $[2, 5]$. Then, if the student $2$ gets interval $[1, 6]$, they will only count $1$ and $6$,
  because all numbers from $2$ to $5$ has been counted by student $1$.    
</p>

<p>
  After all of Pak Chanek's students have counted the numbers, 
  Pak Chanek wonders what is the sum of all the numbers that his students counted.
  Help Pak Chanek satisfy his curiosity!

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  The first line consists of a single integer $N$ - the number of Pak Chanek's students.
</p>

<p>
  The next $N$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ - the interval that the $i$-th student receives from Pak Chanek.
</p>


<h3>Output Format</h3>
