<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix likes recently popular street food called "Es Kepal Moli" a lot. After receiving Jelix's Es Kepal Moli, one of his friends, Fingga got curious, about the method of making Es Kepal Moli. Surprisingly one of the ingredients used by Jelix is Moli branded milk.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Currently, there're $$$N$$$ Moli Milks in Jelix's fridge. Everyday Jelix will use $$$A$$$ Moli Milks to make Es Kepal Moli. To not run out of stock, Jelix buys $$$B$$$ Moli Milks every day and then store in the fridge. Surely, Jelix buys Moli Milk more than he uses each day. Fingga got curious after $$$K$$$ days, how many Moli Milks are in Jelix's fridge. Help Fingga to resolve it!
